# MNISTerySolver
This project involves classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using various machine learning models. The focus is on comparing different classifiers like SGDClassifier, SVC, and Random Forest, with performance evaluation through AUC-ROC curves, confusion matrix, and k-fold cross-validation.
